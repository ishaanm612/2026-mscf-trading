If you are not familiar with Python or feeling a little bit rusty, highly recommend you to go through the following link:
    https://github.com/trekhleb/learn-python

If you have any question about DMA APIs and outputs of code please read:
    https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/#http-methods
    https://rit.306w.ca/RIT-DMA-API/1.0.5/

So bascially：
The core of this case is to design algorithmic trading strategies that exploit arbitrage opportunities between the ETF (RITC) 
and its underlying stocks (BULL and BEAR), while effectively using tender offers and conversion tools to avoid speculative risk
and maximize returns.

# ============================================================================
# DMA REST API CONNECTION BLOCK
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The DMA (Direct Market Access) REST API talks to the RIT *Server* directly,
# so you do NOT need the RIT Client running on your machine. Compared to the
# Client REST API only two things change:
#
#   1. AUTH. Basic authentication with your TraderID and password, instead of
#      the {'X-API-Key': 'Rotman'} header.
#   2. RATE LIMITING. The RIT Client used to absorb this for you. On DMA there
#      is nothing in between you and the server, so a burst of requests comes
#      back as HTTP 429 and you must back off yourself.
#
# Every endpoint, parameter and JSON response is otherwise IDENTICAL to the
# Client REST API, which is why the case logic below is unchanged.
# ============================================================================
